The Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) came looking for help in overhauling their website. They found the UI and UX difficult to maintain, but did not have the expertise to make the corrections they wanted.

To make matters more complex, IAS serves a suite of dozens of websites. Each website coordinates their design, so they all maintain visual consistency.

The theme used to create the UI and UX was fully re-written. To keep consistency across their brand, we sliced out abstract design elements so they could be simply and quickly used anywhere needed. The result is a completely new design architecture and language.

As a result, all stakeholders know how to create new content in a predictable way. Regardless of technical knowledge, they can communicate with technical staff using the new shared design architecture and language.
