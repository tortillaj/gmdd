    <H2>Identifying Pain Points</H2>
    <P>Clarifi needed help developing the design made by another organization. Though the design was largely complete, we needed to provide additional art direction to make a more consistent design.</P>
    <P>The finished website needed to convey optimism and friendliness, and the bright colors of the design and UI elements helped.</P>
    
    <H2>Providing Solutions</H2>
    <P>During development, to ensure a lively website, we focused on creating animated UI elements. The idea was to offset the more sober nature of the topic with a sense of moderated playfulness.</P>
    <P>In additional to custom programming for the entire website, a hightened focus was placed on an interactive UI.</P>
