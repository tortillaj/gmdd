    <H2>Case Study</H2>
    <P>The Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance (GBCA) owns and operates the new Baker Artist Portfolio website. They came with a completed design in-hand, looking for expert Drupal developers to bring it to life.</P>
    <P>Artists in the Baltimore area can create accounts and upload their portfolio of artwork. Then, GBCA staff and other judges review all portfolios to select winners.</P>
    <P>As well, a robust faceted search system allows website visitors to search for particular artists or art styles.</P>
    <P>Strict requirements from the client and coordination with a separate design firm meant clear communication and timeliness were a must.</P>
