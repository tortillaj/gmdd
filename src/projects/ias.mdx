    <H2>Identifying Pain Points</H2>
    <P>They found the UI and UX difficult to maintain, but did not have the expertise to make the corrections they wanted.</P>
    <P>To make matters more complex, IAS serves a suite of dozens of websites. Each website coordinates their design, and they all needed to maintain visual consistency.</P>
    <P>The theme used to create the UI and UX was fully re-written. To keep consistency across their brand, we sliced out abstract design elements so they could be simply and quickly used anywhere needed. The result is a completely new design architecture and language.</P>
    <P>As a result, all stakeholders know how to create new content in a predictable way. Regardless of technical knowledge, they can communicate with technical staff using the new shared design architecture and language.</P>
    
    <H2>Providing Solutions</H2>
    <P>The front-end of the website was completely rewritten, while also maintaining strict visual consisitency with the original design.</P>

    <H2>Responsive Development</H2>
    <P>All Green Mountain Design & Development projects are responsive in nature. Over time, more and more people access the web with handheld devices of all sizes. As a result we put the mobile experience at the forefront of our process.</P>
