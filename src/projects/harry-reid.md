After the 2012 campaign season ended, the staff of Senator Harry Reid reached out to develop a website for the Majority Leader.

To help show off Reid's accomplishments in the Senate, we created the "Recent Voting Record" tool to collect data from [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us). We used this tool to display his voting records and legislative sponsorships.
